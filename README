-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NDSPMHD is an Smoothed Particle (Magneto)Hydrodynamics code for (astrophysical)
fluid dynamics simulations in 1, 2 and 3 spatial dimensions.
It should eventually handle arbitrary co-ordinate systems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code is written in Fortran 90/95 
by Daniel Price, daniel.price@monash.edu

The source code is organised into the following directories:

docs    -- contains documentation for NDSPMHD
evplot  -- visualisation tool for .ev files output by code
multi   -- utility for running multiple jobs
plot    -- (used to) contain the SUPERSPHPLOT package for visualising SPH data
scripts -- various scripts for manipulating data/ running multiple jobs
src     -- source code for NDSPMHD
utils   -- various utilities which use parts of the NDSPMHD source code (kernel
           plotting and stability analysis)
	   
see the INSTALL file for installation instructions
