-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NSPMHD is an Smoothed Particle (Magneto)Hydrodynamics code for (astrophysical)
fluid dynamics simulations in 1, 2 and 3 spatial dimensions.
It should eventually handle arbitrary co-ordinate systems.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code is written in Fortran 90/95 
by Daniel Price, dprice@astro.ex.ac.uk

The source code is organised into the following directories:

docs    -- contains documentation for NDSPMHD
evplot  -- visualisation tool for .ev files output by code
multi   -- utility for running multiple jobs
plot    -- contains the SUPERSPHPLOT package for visualising SPH data
scripts -- various scripts for manipulating data/ running multiple jobs
src     -- source code for NDSPMHD
utils   -- various utilities which use parts of the NDSPMHD source code (kernel
           plotting and stability analysis)

To compile the code, change the compiler options in the file COMPILER
to the compiler installed on your system. By default these are:

F90C = f90     (name of compiler)
F90FLAGS = -O  (optimisation flags)
LDFLAGS =      (links to various libraries - none usually necessary)

then use the makemake.pl script to change these flags in all of the makefiles,
ie. type:

makemake.pl

then simply type

make install

which compiles the code in 1D and makes copies of useful scripts in the main
working directory. To compile all of the code and utilities, type

make all
