To compile the code, change the compiler options in the file COMPILER
to the compiler installed on your system. By default these are:

F90C = f90     (name of compiler)
F90FLAGS = -O  (optimisation flags)
LDFLAGS = -lpgplot -lX11  (links to PGPLOT libraries, used by plotting programs)

then use the makemake.pl script to change these flags in all of the makefiles,
ie. type:

makemake.pl

then simply type

make install

which compiles the code in 1D and makes copies of useful scripts in the main
working directory. To compile all of the code and utilities, type

make all
