To compile SUPERSPHPLOT you will need the following on your system, both of whic
are freely available:
- The PGPLOT graphics subroutine library
- A Fortran 95 compiler

Details on obtaining these are given below.

------------------- PGPLOT -----------------------------------------
The PGPLOT graphics subroutine library is freely downloadable from

http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/}

or by ftp from

ftp://ftp.astro.caltech.edu/pub/pgplot/pgplot5.2.tar.gz}

however check to see if it is already installed on your system (if so, the libraries are
usually located in /usr/local/pgplot).

----------------- Fortran 95 compilers ---------------------------

 By now, many Fortran 9x compilers exist. Amongst the most popular commercially
available ones are perhaps the NAG Fortran compiler and the Intel Fortran
Compiler (ifc, which has a copy freely available for non-commercial use).
However, the g95 project has produced a free compiler, which is downloadable from:

http://www.g95.org

and which successfully compiles both SUPERSPHPLOT and, if necessary, the PGPLOT
libraries. 

Another, apparently unrelated project is located at

http://www.gfortran.org

however this compiler is not fully implemented and therefore does not as yet compile SUPERSPHPLOT.


------------------- Compiling SUPERSPHPLOT --------------------------------
 In the Makefile, you will need to set the FORTRAN compiler and flags to your local version, e.g..

F90C = g95
F90FLAGS = -O

 Secondly the compiler must be able to link to the PGPLOT and X11 libraries on
your system. As a first attempt try using:

LDFLAGS = -lpgplot -lX11

If that works at a first attempt, take a moment to think several happy thoughts about your system
administrator. If these libraries are not found, you will need to enter the
library paths by hand. On most systems this is something like:

LDFLAGS = -L/usr/local/pgplot -lpgplot -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11

(assuming the PGPLOT libraries are in the /usr/local/pgplot directory and the
X11 libraries are in /usr/X11R6/lib). If this does not work, try using the
"locate" command to find the libraries on your system:

crap>locate libpgplot

crap>locate libX11

 If, having found the PGPLOT and X11
libraries, the program still won't compile, it is usually
because the PGPLOT on your system has been compiled with a different compiler to
the one you are using. A first attempt is to try using the g2c libraries

LDFLAGS = -L/usr/local/pgplot -lpgplot -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -lg2c

If the PNG drivers are incorporated into the PGPLOT installation, the -lpng libraries must also be added.
Failing that, ask your system administrator(!) or simply download your own copy of
the PGPLOT libraries and make sure it is compiled with the same compiler as you
are using to compile the SUPERSPHPLOT source code (e.g. g95).

 Secondly, you will need to modify the system-dependent routines for your
compiler. These are located in the file system_unix.f90 which works for most
unix-based compilers (including g95). A file system_unix_NAG
is included for the NAG f95 compiler.

At present the only calls to these routines are made from supersphplot.f90 which
reads the run name(s) from the command line. A standardised format for performing this
task is included in the standards for the next release of Fortran (Fortran 2003),
however in the meantime the calls in the system module may require some adjustment depending on the
particular system you are compiling the code on. The program is still fully
functional without this call working, but it does make things convenient (in particular it means that
SUPERSPHPLOT can be invoked using wildcards (*,?) in filenames).
